# About Me
I'm an electrical and biomedical engineering student with interests in medical imaging, deep learning and signal processing. Here you can find some of the projects I've worked on. 

# Projects
I am currently working on the following projects.
## Bespoke Fractals ([GitHub](https://jacobwhite-dev.github.io/bespoke-fractals/))
This project aims to extend on [chaotic sensing](https://shakes76.github.io/ChaoS/) by allowing the generation of a wide variety of fractal sampling patterns for MRI. 

## VisLaS ([GitHub](https://jacobwhite-dev.github.io/vislas/))
**Vis**ualising **La**tent **S**paces (VisLaS/vislas) is a framework for visualisation of high-dimensional manifolds. It combines dimensionality reduction and plotting into a single package.
